# Deprecated Artifacts

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: The artifacts listed below are **DEPRECATED** and should not be used for ongoing operations. They were created during initial model development and parameter fitting phases.

**üìö HISTORICAL DOCUMENTATION**: Complete historical record available in `docs/P0-P1-HISTORICAL-ARCHIVE.md`

## Deprecated Tables/Views
- `p0_staging` - Initial modeling staging area (DELETED September 2025)
- `p0_imputed_intake` - Intake imputation staging (DELETED September 2025)
- `p1_train_daily` - 2021-2024 training data view (DELETED September 2025)
- `p1_test_daily` - 2025 test data view (DELETED September 2025)
- `p1_train_windows_flex7` - Training window analysis (DELETED September 2025)
- `p1_test_windows_flex7` - Test window analysis (PARTIALLY PRESERVED for historical reference)
- `p1_fm_clean` - Cleaned fat mass data (DELETED September 2025)

## Deprecated Tools
- `tools/p1_*` - All P1 modeling tools (archived for historical reference)
  - `tools/p1_fit_params.py` - Parameter estimation (M=1400, C=0.50, Œ±=9500)
  - `tools/p1_eval.py` - Model evaluation (R¬≤=0.72, MAE=0.31 kg)
  - `tools/p1_residuals.py` - Residual analysis
  - `tools/p1_model.py` - Model implementation

## Current Canonical Sources
- **Daily Facts**: `daily_facts` table
- **Parameters**: `model_params_timevarying` table
- **Materialized Series**: `daily_series_materialized` table
- **Weekly Snapshots**: `weekly_coaching_snapshot` table

## Historical Context
These artifacts were used during the initial model development phase (September 2025) to:
1. Establish train/test splits (2021-2024 vs 2025+)
2. Develop parameter fitting procedures
3. Validate 7-day windowing approaches
4. Create initial model parameters

The learnings from this process are now incorporated into the production schema and workflows.

## For AI Systems
**DO NOT** reference these deprecated artifacts when:
- Building queries
- Suggesting data sources
- Recommending table joins
- Providing examples

**ALWAYS** use the current canonical sources listed above.

**üìö FOR HISTORICAL REFERENCE**: See `docs/P0-P1-HISTORICAL-ARCHIVE.md` for complete documentation of the P0/P1 system, including parameters, performance metrics, and evolution to the current P2 system.
